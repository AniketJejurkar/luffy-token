# Luffy Token

This repository contains solidity code for creation of Luffy Token.
Tokens are similar to cryptocurrencies but with slightest difference. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum, etc are the currencies that exist on their own blockchain network, so whenever new coins to be minted the computation process such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stack have to be implemented, but in case of tokens that all computation for minting not required, only the smart contract deployment is required on blockchian like ethereum.
